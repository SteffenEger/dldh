# Deep Learning and Digital Humanities (DLDH), 2021

## Organization

The seminar is held by [Steffen Eger](https://steffeneger.github.io/).

This year, there will be two tracks: 

- In the **presentation track**, teams of 1-2 students present on a topic comprising 1-4 papers. They will (1) prepare slides, (2) present the slides in an offline video, (3) watch other students' videos and write brief summaries, (4) answer questions on their own video in an online discussion and (5) finally write a term paper of 4-6 pages (1 person) or 5.5-7 pages (2 people). We will allow 3-5 teams in the presentation track.

- In the **project track**, teams of 3-5 students work on a novel topic. They read literature and then implement a solution to the problem. There will be 3 monthly exchanges with the supervisor. At the end, the students write a joint (term) paper of 8-10 pages. We will allow at most 4 teams in the project track.

### Meetings

There will be an initial meeting (26.10.2021) as well as a final presentation meeting in the presentation track (early February). In the project track, there will be 3 meetings (one in November, one in December, and one in January). 

### Language
The seminar will be held in English.
